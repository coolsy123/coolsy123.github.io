     <h1>staring off with a code editor</h1>
<p>you can start of with a code edtior. that is how websites are made. you can use a smiple one like notepad, or go next level and use other code text editor like attom and visual studio code like i am using. it dosen't matter what code text editor you use, it matter if it's the right one.</p>
<p>i recomand sublime text 3 and visual studio code. but it's up to you wich one you like</p>
<ol>
         <li>visual studio code</li>
         <li>sublime text 3</li>
         <li>attom</li>
         <li>notepad</li>
     </ol>
     <p> these are all i recomand</p>


     <h1>adding coding to your editor</h1>
     <p>step 1. go to your file explorer and create
     a new folder. once you finish creating that folder go inside that folder 
    and add another folder and name it website. 
    after that your done with step one of adding some code to your editor.</p>
     <p>step 2. to go to your text code editor and make a new file. name it, then
     set it as an html file. now your done with step nubmer 2 </p>
